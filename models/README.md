# Model Weights – GomMold Mold Detection

The trained YOLOv8 model used in this project is not stored directly inside the repository because the `.pt` file exceeds GitHub’s file size limit.

Instead, the model is provided through an external download link.  
This ensures the file does not become corrupted and remains accessible for deployment.
